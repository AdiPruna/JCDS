This project will contain the files for my final project submision for the Data Science: Capstone course on Edx.
For this project we will use the Kaggle HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists data set the set can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/sohommajumder21/hr-analytics-predictions-listed. I uplded here so i can write the code without the need to manualy load the files. As this is my first time working with Kaggle, I will focus on the algorythm and learn how to use the Kaggle API on R at a later stage.
